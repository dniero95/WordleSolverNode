A web app solver to win the game Wordle

## User Requirements

**Request**: Wordle Solving Tool
To reduce our employees' coffee breaks, we have decided to provide them with a tool for solving Wordles in Italian (https://wordleitaliano.com/), so that they can finish a quiz more quickly.

 - Provide a user manual to simplify the first approach to employees

 ## Approach to solution
